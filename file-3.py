smelly mcpoopface was eating his dinner of dog feces, when he suddenly realized, "wait. i'm a big lump of poop. dog feces... are lumps of poop. so does that mean..."he sat there thinking for a while. well, "sat" might not be the right word. he was sitting... but as far as i know, he's still there pondering this question. (spoiler alert: he ends up becoming poop-vegan, which is like veganism, but with poop instead, as the name suggests.)
